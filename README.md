# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-System-Demand

## 2. Introduction
#### Hypothesis (Objectives / Goals)

1. Examine how different weather conditions impact bike rentals.
2. Determine if there are differences in bike rentals on working days and non-working days.
3. Investigate the impact of holidays on bike rentals.
4. Is there a discernible impact of temperature on bike rentals.
5. How well those variables predict the bike demands.


#### Significance of the project

We are modelling the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It could be used by the management of the bike companies to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

By leveraging the rich dataset provided by bike-sharing systems, the research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of urban mobility patterns. This knowledge can inform city planning, transportation policies, and infrastructure development, ultimately leading to more sustainable and efficient urban environments. Furthermore, the project's findings may have implications for addressing broader issues related to smart city initiatives and the integration of data-driven solutions into urban planning.


#### Background of the project

Bike sharing systems represent an innovative evolution of traditional bike rentals, automating the entire process from membership acquisition to bike rental and return. Users can seamlessly rent a bike from one location and return it to another, marking a departure from conventional rental systems. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs globally, collectively offering more than 500,000 bicycles. These systems have garnered significant interest due to their pivotal role in addressing traffic congestion, environmental concerns, and public health.

Beyond their practical applications, bike-sharing systems generate data with distinctive characteristics that make them intriguing for research. Unlike other transportation services like buses or subways, bike-sharing systems explicitly record travel duration, departure, and arrival positions. This unique feature transforms bike-sharing systems into virtual sensor networks capable of sensing mobility patterns within a city. Consequently, the project anticipates that important urban events can be detected by monitoring this data.

The primary objective of the project is to model the demand for shared bikes by considering various independent variables. This modeling can prove invaluable for the management of bike companies, offering insights into how demand varies with different features. Armed with this understanding, management can strategically manipulate business approaches to meet demand levels and exceed customer expectations. Moreover, the model provides a valuable tool for comprehending the dynamics of demand in new markets.

Through the utilization of the expansive dataset provided by bike-sharing systems, the research endeavors to provide a comprehensive understanding of urban mobility patterns. The insights derived from this analysis can play a crucial role in informing city planning, shaping transportation policies, and guiding infrastructure development. The ultimate aim is to contribute to the creation of more sustainable and efficient urban environments. Furthermore, the project's findings may extend to addressing broader issues related to smart city initiatives and the integration of data-driven solutions into urban planning practices.


## 3. Data Description
**Source of Information :** Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset
    
**Description :** Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.
